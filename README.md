🚀 Executive Summary

Restora Wallet is a next-generation Web3 wallet designed to fix the core vulnerabilities of traditional seed-phrase wallets.
We introduce a multi-layered security model that combines:

🔑 Trust Key (Password Protection) – mandatory before recovery and transactions.

🌱 Non-Compatible Recovery Seeds – cannot be imported into other wallets, blocking seed-only exploits.


Our mission: restore trust in crypto security by making Web3 safer and simpler for everyone.

⚡ Unified Gas Token ($FZ) – Pay all fees with one token.
